### UML ###

The elements are like components which can be associated in different ways to make a complete UML picture, which is known as diagram. Thus, it is very important to understand the different diagrams to implement the knowledge in real-life systems.

Any complex system is best understood by making some kind of diagrams or pictures. These diagrams have a better impact on our understanding. If we look around, we will realize that the diagrams are not a new concept but it is used widely in different forms in different industries.

There are two broad categories of diagrams and they are again divided into subcategories −

- Structural Diagrams

- Behavioral Diagrams


## Structural Diagrams ##

The structural diagrams represent the static aspect of the system. These static aspects represent those parts of a diagram, which forms the main structure and are therefore stable.

These static parts are represented by classes, interfaces, objects, components, and nodes. The four structural diagrams are −

Class diagram

Object diagram

Component diagram

Deployment diagram



## Behavioral Diagrams ##

Any system can have two aspects, static and dynamic. So, a model is considered as complete when both the aspects are fully covered.

Behavioral diagrams basically capture the dynamic aspect of a system. Dynamic aspect can be further described as the changing/moving parts of a system.

UML has the following five types of behavioral diagrams −

Use case diagram

Sequence diagram

Collaboration diagram

Statechart diagram

Activity diagram
